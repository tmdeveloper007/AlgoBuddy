  const questions = [
    {
      question: "What is the basic principle of linear search?",
      options: [
        "Dividing the list in half repeatedly",
        "Checking each element one by one from the start",
        "Sorting the list first then searching",
        "Starting from the middle of the list"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Linear search works by checking each element sequentially from the beginning until it finds the target value."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the time complexity of linear search in the worst case?",
      options: [
        "O(1)",
        "O(log n)",
        "O(n)",
        "O(n²)"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "In the worst case (when the target is last or not present), linear search checks all n elements, resulting in O(n) complexity."
    },
    {
      question: "In the array [5, 3, 8, 1, 9], how many comparisons are needed to find the number 1?",
      options: [
        "1",
        "2",
        "3",
        "4"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "The search checks 5 (1st), 3 (2nd), 8 (3rd), and finally finds 1 on the 4th comparison."
    },
    {
      question: "When would linear search perform at its best?",
      options: [
        "When the target is at the end of the list",
        "When the target is at the middle of the list",
        "When the target is at the beginning of the list",
        "When the list is sorted"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Linear search performs best (O(1)) when the target is the first element, as it only needs one comparison."
    },
    {
      question: "What would a linear search algorithm return if the target value is not in the list?",
      options: [
        "The first element",
        "The last element",
        "An error message",
        "A 'not found' indication"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "When the target isn't found, linear search typically returns a special value (like -1 or 'not found') to indicate this."
    },
    {
  question: "Can linear search be used on an unsorted array?",
  options: [
    "Yes",
    "No",
    "Only if the array has unique elements",
    "Only for integer arrays"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 0,
  explanation: "Linear search works on both sorted and unsorted arrays because it checks each element sequentially."
},
{
  question: "Which of the following is an advantage of linear search?",
  options: [
    "Requires the array to be sorted",
    "Simple to implement and works on unsorted data",
    "Always runs in O(log n)",
    "Uses recursion by default"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "Linear search is easy to implement and does not require the data to be sorted."
},
{
  question: "What is the average time complexity of linear search?",
  options: [
    "O(1)",
    "O(log n)",
    "O(n)",
    "O(n log n)"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 2,
  explanation: "On average, linear search checks about half of the elements before finding the target, giving O(n) complexity."
},
{
  question: "If an array contains duplicate values, what happens during a standard linear search?",
  options: [
    "It returns the last occurrence",
    "It returns the first matching occurrence",
    "It returns all occurrences automatically",
    "It throws an error"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "A standard linear search stops as soon as it finds the first matching element."
},
{
  question: "Which scenario is most suitable for using linear search?",
  options: [
    "A very large sorted dataset",
    "A small or unsorted dataset",
    "A balanced binary search tree",
    "A hash table"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "Linear search is ideal for small datasets or when the data is unsorted and sorting isn't worthwhile."
