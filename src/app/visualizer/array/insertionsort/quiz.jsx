  const questions = [
    {
      question: "What is the basic principle of Insertion Sort?",
      options: [
        "Dividing the list into smaller sublists and merging them",
        "Building the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element in its correct position",
        "Repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order",
        "Selecting the smallest element and moving it to the front"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Insertion Sort works by building the final sorted array one item at a time, similar to how you might sort playing cards in your hands."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the time complexity of Insertion Sort in the worst case?",
      options: [
        "O(n)",
        "O(n log n)",
        "O(n²)",
        "O(1)"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "In the worst case (when the list is sorted in reverse order), Insertion Sort requires O(n²) comparisons and shifts."
    },
    {
      question: "In the array [7, 3, 5, 2, 1], how many shifts occur when inserting the element '2'?",
      options: [
        "1",
        "2",
        "3",
        "4"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "When inserting '2', we need to shift '7', '5', and '3' to the right (3 shifts) before inserting '2' at the beginning."
    },
    {
      question: "When would Insertion Sort perform at its best?",
      options: [
        "When the array is in random order",
        "When the array is sorted in reverse order",
        "When the array is already sorted",
        "When the array contains duplicate values"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Insertion Sort performs best (O(n)) when the array is already sorted, as it only needs to make comparisons without any shifts."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the space complexity of Insertion Sort?",
      options: [
        "O(n)",
        "O(n log n)",

      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Insertion Sort is an in-place algorithm that only requires O(1) additional space for temporary storage during shifts."
    },
    {
      question: "Which of these is NOT an advantage of Insertion Sort?",
      options: [
        "Efficient for small datasets",
        "Stable (maintains relative order of equal elements)",
        "Online (can sort as it receives input)",
        "Efficient for large, randomly ordered datasets"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Insertion Sort is not efficient for large, randomly ordered datasets due to its O(n²) average time complexity."
    },
    {
      question: "Why might hybrid algorithms like TimSort use Insertion Sort?",
      options: [
        "Because it's the fastest sorting algorithm for all cases",
        "Because it has excellent cache performance",
        "Because of its low overhead for small subarrays",
        "Because it's the easiest to implement"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Hybrid algorithms often use Insertion Sort for small subarrays (typically ≤ 10 elements) due to its low overhead and good performance on small datasets."
    },
    {
  question: "What is the basic idea behind Insertion Sort?",
  options: [
    "Repeatedly swap adjacent elements",
    "Insert each element into its correct position in the sorted portion",
    "Divide the array into halves",
    "Always select the largest element first"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "Insertion Sort builds a sorted portion of the array by inserting each new element into its correct position."
},
{
  question: "What is the worst-case time complexity of Insertion Sort?",
  options: [
    "O(log n)",
    "O(n)",
    "O(n log n)",
    "O(n²)"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 3,
  explanation: "In the worst case (reverse sorted array), each element must be shifted through the sorted portion, giving O(n²) time complexity."
},
{
  question: "When does Insertion Sort achieve its best-case time complexity?",
  options: [
    "When the array is already sorted",
    "When the array is reverse sorted",
    "When all elements are different",
    "When the array has duplicates"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 0,
  explanation: "If the array is already sorted, Insertion Sort only performs comparisons, resulting in O(n) time complexity."
},
{
  question: "Is Insertion Sort a stable sorting algorithm?",
  options: [
    "Yes",
    "No",
    "Only for integers",
    "Only for sorted arrays"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 0,
  explanation: "Insertion Sort is stable because equal elements retain their original relative order."

  question: "Which type of dataset is Insertion Sort most suitable for?",
  options: [
    "Very large random datasets",
    "Small or nearly sorted datasets",
    "Distributed datasets",
    "Binary trees"

  question: "How does Insertion Sort build the sorted array?",
  options: [
    "By repeatedly merging subarrays",
    "By inserting one element at a time into its correct position",
    "By selecting the largest element first",

    "The entire array",
    "The left portion of the array",
    "The right portion of the array",
    "Only the last element"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "The left portion of the array is maintained in sorted order, while the remaining elements are processed one by one."
},
{
  question: "What is the auxiliary space complexity of Insertion Sort?",
  options: [
    "O(1)",
    "O(log n)",
    "O(n)",
    "O(n²)"

  options: [
    "Merging",
    "Partitioning",
    "Shifting elements",
    "Recursion"

  options: [
    "n",
    "n - 1",
    "log n",
    "n²"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "Insertion Sort requires n−1 passes because the first element is already considered sorted."
},

  options: [
    "Comparison-based sorting",
    "Non-comparison sorting",
    "Hashing algorithm",
    "Graph algorithm"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 0,
  explanation: "Insertion Sort compares elements to determine their correct order, making it a comparison-based sorting algorithm."
},
{
  question: "Why is Insertion Sort considered adaptive?",
  options: [
    "It changes into Merge Sort automatically",
    "It performs faster on nearly sorted arrays",
    "It uses recursion when needed",
    "It reduces memory usage dynamically"
