## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, npm

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PankajSingh34/AlgoBuddy.git
cd AlgoBuddy

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp EnvExample.txt .env.local
# Fill in the values — see Environment Variables section below

# 4. Run the development server
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the root with the following keys (see `EnvExample.txt`):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `EMAIL_USER` | Gmail address used to send contact/review emails |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Gmail App Password (not your account password) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` | Google Analytics Measurement ID |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anonymous/public key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Supabase service role key (server-side only) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | Cloudflare Turnstile site key |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | Cloudflare Turnstile secret key |

Never commit `.env.local` to version control. It is listed in `.gitignore`.
